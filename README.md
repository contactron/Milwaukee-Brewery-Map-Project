# Udacity Front-End Nanondegree Neighborhood Maps Project

## Project Description

This application displays a list and map of Milwaukee breweries and details for each Brewery from the Brewery's Yelp account.


## Running Instructions

This project can be found in this GitHub repository:
https://github.com/contactron/Milwaukee-Brewery-Map-Project.git

To run the application clone or download the repository to your local machine. Then simply double-click on the index.html file in the main directly.

## Functionality

On launch the application will load a Google Map of Milwaukee, Wisconsin and display a list of local, Milwaukee breweries. Markers on the map indicate their location.

Filtering - The user can then filter the list using the search input field above the list of Breweries. As the user types in a keyword the list of Breweries and their associated markers will update to only include Brewery names that match the inputted text.

Getting Brewery Details - The user can also click on either a Brewery from the list or on one of the map markers to see the name of the Brewery and the first image from the Brewery's Yelp account. In future iterations, review ratings and other business information from Yelp will be added.

## Acknowledgements

This app leveraged code from several sources:
* Udacity's FE Nanodegree Lessons on Advanced Interactive Websites, in particular the Google Maps lesson "Devil In The Details"
* SlideoutJS for the mobile respsonsive menu slider. https://slideout.js.org/

Also, integrated Yelp reviews would have been impossible without this writeup:

as well as everyone who contributed to the Udacity Forum thread discussing the Yelp Fusion API:

Finally, I got some great help structuring my code from the Udacity forum for this project. My thanks in particular to Viraj-3 who provided some great feedback and got me on a better path.
